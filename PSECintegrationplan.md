# PSEC Electronics Integration Plan

The goal of this effort is to produce a single, self contained package that powers the LAPPD and readout electronics, handles communications, and manages the slow controls. 

The goal is to have a fully functioning realization of this system by early-to-mid January. There are several components
of the system:

* The Analog Pick-Up Board: This is the board that bring the signals from the LAPPD around the backside of a PCB with XX connectors to mate with the ACDC cards.

* The Bridge Boards: make the connection 

* The two ACDC cards: 

* LV-HV Board
